## Devops Processes

Plan: This stage involves defining the objectives and requirements of the project. It includes tasks such as creating user stories, defining features, and planning the development process.

Code: In this stage, developers write code to implement the features and functionalities defined in the planning stage. This could involve writing new code, updating existing code, or integrating third-party libraries.

Build: The code written by developers is compiled and built into executable or deployable artifacts. This stage also involves tasks like dependency management, compiling, and packaging the code.

Test: Once the build is complete, the application undergoes various testing processes to ensure its quality. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and automated testing.

Release: In this stage, the tested code is deployed to a staging or production environment. This may involve tasks like provisioning infrastructure, configuring servers, and deploying the application.

Deploy: The release artifacts are deployed to the target environment, making the application available for end-users. This stage may involve tasks like rolling out updates, managing deployments, and monitoring the deployment process.

Operate/Monitor: Once the application is deployed, it needs to be monitored and maintained to ensure its availability, performance, and reliability. This involves tasks like monitoring server health, analyzing logs, and responding to incidents.

Feedback: Throughout the process, feedback is collected from various sources, including users, stakeholders, and monitoring systems. This feedback is used to iterate on the application and improve its quality.

Iterate: Based on the feedback received, the development team iterates on the application, making improvements, fixing bugs, and adding new features. This iterative process continues throughout the lifecycle of the application.
